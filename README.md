# Video compression pipeline

Video compression script compress_videos.py. This script was used to encode dataset camera feed images into MJPEG, H.264, and H.265 encoded videos and then decode them back to individual frames. The script was used to examine the lossy compression effect for different video codecs. 

Source code, for generating simulation dataset, is available here: https://github.com/TO-autonomy/CARLA-vehicle-simulation.git
